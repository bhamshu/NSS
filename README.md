# Blood Donation System

**Step 1.**
Simply visit https://tinyurl.com/bloodnssdemo.  Watch the above( [How We Work](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17nIat-GgiB-2KqJq7hb5Du7DmvQGdH3P)) one minute video for a complete walk through.

Alternatively visit https://tinyurl.com/bloodrecordsdemo and enter _username: demo_, _password: demo_ for a demo on a dummy database.

Alternatively, run main.py from the project directory. 

**Step 2.**
Pick hospital coordinates from Google*. For example, if the patient is in AIIMS, [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=aiims+latitude+longitude) Google for "AIIMS latitude longitude" and copy paste the result exactly in the text box. Put space separated list of blood groups required. One by one, the details of the nearest volunteers will be shown using MapQuest API.

\*This was _not_ built into the application to increase reliability. As an example, there might be more than one hospital with same name. Doing google search forces the volunteers to verify location.
