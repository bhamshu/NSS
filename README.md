# Blood Donation System

**Step 1.**
Visit tinyurl.com/bloodrecords and enter _username: demo_, _password: demo_ for a demo on a dummy database. Watch this [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17nIat-GgiB-2KqJq7hb5Du7DmvQGdH3P) for a complete walk through in a minute.

Alternatively, run main.py from the project directory. 

**Step 2.**
Pick hospital coordinates from Google*. For example, if the patient is in AIIMS, [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=aiims+latitude+longitude) Google for "AIIMS latitude longitude" and copy paste the result exactly in the terminal. Put space separated list of blood groups required. One by one, the details of the nearest volunteers will be shown using MapQuest API.

\*This was _not_ built into the application to increase reliability. There might be two hospitals with the same name, as an example, and that is why human volunteers are needed to search it themselves.
