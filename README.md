**Blood Donation System**

Run main.py from the project directory. Pick hospital coordinates from Google. For example, if the patient is in AIIMS, [search](https://www.google.com/search?q=aiims+latitude+longitude) Google for "AIIMS latitude longitude" and copy paste the result exactly in the terminal. One by one, the details of the nearest volunteers will be shown using MapQuest API.
